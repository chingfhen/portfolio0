# AI in Job Hiring
Job Hiring processes are often tedious; analyzing the suitability of very large numbers candidates takes considerable time and effort. Ensuring fair analysis for all candidates may also be challenging; it is possible that some candidates are wrongly passed off due to human error or lack of domain knowledge. 

We can leverage Artifical Intelligence (AI) to streamline this process of filtering, ranking and analysis of candidates. This can potentially save considerable time for Human Resource (HR) teams and possibly find better fitting candidates.
