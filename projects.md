## [Project: AI in Financial Analytics](https://chingfhen.github.io/portfolio0/ai_financials.html)
Analysing financial data with the goal of making informed business decisions can be challenging without the right domain knowledge, mathematical and statistical skillsets. By leveraging Generative AI, I was able to bridge this gap. 

I implemented AI Solutions that is able to analyse financial data, perform statistical techniques and generate insights that helped key decision makers to make strategic business decisions more rapidly. Full Solution Documentation can be found [here](https://chingfhen.github.io/portfolio0/ai_financials.html).

#### 1. Financial Analytics PowerBI Dashboard with AI Insights
Developed and integrated Generative AI Insights into Financial Analytics PowerBI Reports. Scheduled jobs to keep AI insights updated.

The AI can perform complex calculations to generate insights for various financial analysis such as Liquidity Analysis and Accounts Receivable Turnover Analysis. 

Examples of insights:

> The company's Quick Ratio for the latest month is approximately 1.71, indicating it has $1.71 in liquid assets for every $1 of current liabilities.

> The Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is calculated to be approximately 0.36, indicating the company is slow in collecting outstanding accounts.

## Project: AI in Job Hiring Analytics
Job Hiring is often a tedious task because the HR needs to filter and analyse hundreds of applicants to find the right candidates for a job role. Through the utilization of AI, we can streamline this process easier for HR. 

I implemented AI Solutions that can filter, analyse and summarize job applications, which improved the efficiency of job hiring processes for HR.

## Project: AI in Aftersales Fault Diagnosis
In aftersales, customers may encounter issues with their electronic appliance, and they would contact the customer service team to resolve their issue. Diagnosing the problem correctly over the phone require extensive experience and customer service teams often encounter large volume of service requests. As a result, leveraging AI to predict the possible faults based on the customer description can be useful in improving aftersales processes. 

I trained and deployed classification models to accurately predict fault codes based on customer description.
